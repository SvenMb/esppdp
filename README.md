#What is this?

This is the source repository for esppdp, which is a tiny VT-102 scale model housing an
ESP32 emulating a PDP11. You can connect a BlueTooth keyboard to it and play the
original Tetris, or do some die-hard computing on 2.11BSD.

#Why?

Well, someone had to put back the 'mini' in 'minicomputer', right?
